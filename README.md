# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

This purpose of this project is to use supervised machine learning models for a company trying to better issue credit card loans. The goal was to predict high risk credit with a high accuracy and with a level of sensitivity and precision that would not allow for great creditors to be declined for bias. Oversampling, undersampling, a combination of the two, plus a bias reducing model were the tecniques used to evaluate credit risk. 

## Machine Learning Models

Naive Random Oversampling
SMOTE Oversampling
Cluster Centroid Undersampling
SMOTEENN Sampling
Balanced Random Forest Classifying
Easy Ensemble Classifying

## Results
## Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

### Random Oversampler
